# My first project with elasticsearch

### steps:
```
npm install
```

You need to have a elasticsearch serwer running on port 9200

At first run make sure, that in file routes.js following lines are uncommented
```
const users = require('./seeds');
users.forEach((user) => {
  elasticClient.index({
    index: 'users',
    body: user
  });
});
```

Then start application server:
```
npm run start
```

And make sure, that after starting server you commented following lines in file routes.js
```
const users = require('./seeds');
users.forEach((user) => {
  elasticClient.index({
    index: 'users',
    body: user
  });
});
```

These lines are responsible for users seeds to elasticsearch. I'm working on better solution.

In seeds are 1000 users generated by faker.js

You can see how search engine is working by following endpoint:
```
get localhost:3000/api/v1/users
```

You can add searching parameter:
```
get localhost:3000/api/v1/users?user=Division
```

I set response size: 100, you can modify it in routes.js in lines:
```
router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  let query = {
    index: 'users',
    size: 100
  };

  if (req.query.user) {
    query.q = `*${req.query.user}*`;
  }

  elasticClient.search(query)
```
